# Event Management & Ticketing Platform

## Project Description
This project focuses on creating a microservice-based event management and ticketing platform.

### Functionalities
- Event management
- Ticketing platform
- User management
- Payment gateway
- Notification service
- Report service

### Non-functional Requirements
- Scalability
- High availability
- Security

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Microservice Architecture
- **Service Decomposition**: Learn how to break down your application into different microservices based on functionalities.
- **API Gateway**: Explore how to use API gateways to manage communication between clients and microservices.
- **Inter-service Communication**: Study different communication patterns (e.g., REST, gRPC, message queues).
- **Service Discovery**: Understand how services find and communicate with each other in a distributed system.
- **Data Management**: Explore strategies like Database per Service, CQRS, and Event Sourcing.
- **Security**: Implement OAuth2, JWT, and API key management for secure microservice communication.

### 2. Deployment and Orchestration
- **Containerization**: Containerize each microservice using Docker.
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy and manage your microservices using Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Service Mesh**: Explore Istio or Linkerd for managing service-to-service communications, security, and observability.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform or Ansible to manage your infrastructure declaratively.

### 3. Monitoring
- **Logging**: Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki.
- **Metrics and Tracing**: Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Explore distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for your microservices and monitor them using Kubernetes or external tools.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting mechanisms using Grafana or Prometheus Alertmanager to notify you of critical issues.

### 4. Load Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Use tools like Apache JMeter, Gatling, or Locust to simulate load and test the performance of your services.
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points of your application under high traffic.
- **Scalability Testing**: Test how your application scales under increasing load and how it behaves when scaling up and down.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Experiment with tools like Chaos Monkey to inject failures and observe system resilience.
